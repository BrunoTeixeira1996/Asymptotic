# API-PHP-Project
A small project I made using the discogs.com API. 
I was trying to learn some new things, so I decided that I should work with an API while using PHP. 

# About Asymptotic
Asymptotic is a WebApp that is used to search all the discography that a music artist did. It uses a very simple and amazing API from Discogs, a little bit of PHP and Bootstrap. Remember that Discogs allow contributors to put their albums on their website(For example: for sale and/or exchange) so it's normal that some covers/names are not in English.
