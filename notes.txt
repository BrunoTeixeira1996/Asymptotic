Some notes that i took while i was doing this project.


HTTP headers are the core part of HTTP requests and responses, and they carry information about the client browser, the request page, the server, etc...
There are methods that indicates what kind of request we are using. Commonly we use GET,POST and HEAD.
GET - Retrieves html, images, etc.There is a query string in the path (e.g GET /test.php?name=Bruno HTTP/1.1)
POST - Send data do the server ( we can still use GET to send data)(commonly sent by web forms)There is no query string in the path (e.g POST /test.php HTTP/1.1)
HEAD - HEAD is similar to GET, except the server does not return the content in the HTTP response(e g if you have link's on your website you can send HEAD requests to them to check if they are broken)



cURL allows transfer of data across a wide variety of protocols, and is a very powerful system. It's widely used as a way to send data across websites, including things like API's.
curl_init - initializes a new session and return a cURL handle for use with ...setopt, ...exec.
curl_setopt_array - sets and option on the given cURL session handle.
curl_exec - method which will execute the cURL request.
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER - Return the response as a string instead of outputting it to the screen
CURLOPT_URL - URL to send request to
CURLOPT_USERAGENT - Useragent string to use for request

The foreach construct provides an easy way to iterate over arrays.Foreach works only on arrays and objects.

foreach(array_expression as $value)
	statement

On each iteration, the value of the current element is assigned to $value and the internal array pointer is advanced by one.
